--line 1A Narrator--
In this story, there are four friends—Kevin, AJ, Lyza, and Rhema. One day, they decided to have a sleepover at Rhema’s house, 
which was located near a dark and silent forest. 
Their friendship was strong; they treated each other like family, bound together like siblings. They were deeply attached to one another.
However, there was one unsettling thing that Kevin noticed about Rhema. Sometimes, she behaved strangely—her silence lingering too long, her gaze seeming distant.
He felt that something was wrong, something Rhema was hiding and refusing to tell them.

--Line 2A Line--
Because of this, he decided to have a sleepover at Rhema’s house to investigate. 
After thinking about the plan, he immediately told AJ and Lyza what he had in mind. 
Together, they asked Rhema if they could stay over. 
Rhema hesitated, her voice low and uneasy, before quietly asking, 

Rhema - “Are you guys sure?”

Without hesitation, they replied, 

Kevin, Aj, Lyza - “Yes. We’re really sure.”

--Line 3A Narrator--
And that was when everything began.
The night they went to Rhema's house, the air already felt wrong. 
It was supposed to be a simple sleepover—blankets on the floor, phones glowing dimly, rain tapping against the windows like impatient fingers.
As the evening dragged on, the four of them sat in a loose circle, talking about their lives. Kevin complained about school. AJ admitted he hadn't been sleeping well. 
Lyza talked about her fear of being left behind.
Rhema said nothing.

--Line 4A Narrator--
She sat cross-legged near the window, her face half-hidden by shadow. Every time someone asked if she was okay, she only smiled-slow, tight, unreadable.
That silence pressed harder than any words, and soon Kevin, AJ, and Lyza started exchanging uneasy glances. Whatever Rhema was hiding felt heavier than the dark outside.
Trying to break the tension, Kevin laughed nervously and began telling a story.
At first, it sounded harmless—an old local legend. A forest near Rhema's house. People who went in after sunset. 
Voices that mimicked your friends. Footsteps that followed you even when no one was there.

--Line 5A Line--
As his voice lowered, the lights flickered.
--Line 6A Line--
"Kevin, you should stop," AJ said, his voice tight.
--Line 7A Line--
"Yeah," Lyza added. "This isn't funny."
--Line 8A Line--
Kevin froze. "Alright. I'Il stop."
--Line 9A Line--
Silence fell again.

--Line 10A Line--
Then Rhema spoke.
Her voice was calm. Too calm.

--Line 10A Line--
"What if we go to the forest?" she said softly. "You guys want that, right?"
--Line 11A Line--
The rain stopped.
Kevin's eyes lit up. "Yes. I want that. How about you, AJ? Lyza?"
--Line 12A Line--
"I don't want to go," AJ said immediately.
--Line 13A Line--
Lyza hesitated. "Maybe... maybe we can do that tomorrow morning. Not now."
Rhema tilted her head, her smile widening just a little.
--Line 14A Line--
Kevin stood up. "Girl, we're just going there. Nothing's gonna happen to us. So-let's go."

--Line 15A Line--
Before anyone could argue, Rhema was already at the door, slipping on her shoes.
AJ and lyza followed—by no choice.
The forest swallowed them the moment they stepped inside. The trees were too close together, 
their branches tangled like broken fingers. The path Rhema promised was there seemed to disappear the deeper they went.

--Line 16A Line--
"Rhema," Lyza whispered, her voice barely breaking the silence. "Are you sure this is the way?"

Rhema slowed her steps.
"Yes," she said after a pause. "As far as 1 remember... this is the way going into the
forest."
The trees seemed to lean closer.
"You hear that?" Kevin asked suddenly.
Footsteps echoed behind them.
AJ turned around sharply. "That's just us."

They stopped walking.

The footsteps didn't.

Lyza screamed.

"Lyza, stop screaming," Kevin snapped, irritation slipping into his voice. "Just-just calm down, please."

Her breathing came out uneven, almost painful.

"Guys," AJ said quietly. "Look at this."

They followed his gaze.

Between the trees stood a house.

Old. Crooked. Half-swallowed by shadows.

"A house..." Kevin whispered.

"I'm so scared," Lyza said, her voice cracking as if she might cry.

Rhema stared at the house without speaking, her face unreadable.

"What do you guys think? she finally asked.

"We'll go there and see," Kevin said, forcing confidence into his voice.

AJ hesitated. "Are you sure about that, Kevin?"

"Of course," Kevin replied quickly. 
“There's nothing to worry about. It's just a house."

Rhema didn't answer.

She only kept staring at the house-as if she recognized it, or worse,
as if it was staring back.

Once they entered the house, an uneasy silence swallowed them whole. The place was... clean. Too clean.

Not a speck of dust, not a single sign of abandonment—as if someone had just been there, watching.

No one spoke. Their eyes slowly traced the walls, the furniture, the shadows that felt slightly off.

Suddenly, Lyza turned and ran for the door.

BANG.

The door slammed shut on its own. The sound echoed through the house, sharp and final. Lyza screamed, her voice cracking as panic took over.

"S***" Rhema muttered under her breath.

"Oh my God... we're in a trap now," AJ said, his voice shaking. "What are we going to do? F**** this!”

"This is all your fault, Kevin," Lyza snapped, pointing at him with trembling hands. "This was your plan. F*** Why did I even go along with you?"

"You b****" Kevin hissed, his smile slowly fading into something colder.

Rhema stared at them, her chest tightening. None of this made sense. Her confusion slowly turned into anger.

"What are you talking about?" she demanded. "What is going on?!"

"Stop it," AJ said quickly. "Fighting won't help us right now."

Lyza swallowed hard, then spoke. "Kevin wanted to investigate you, Rhema, You've been acting strange lately
—like you're hiding something. Kevin noticed it and told us. That's why we asked to have a sleepover in your house."

"That's a lie!" Kevin shouted. "Stop lying!"

Rhema's blood ran cold. She slowly turned to Kevin.

"What the f*** is this, Kevin?" she said, her voice low and dangerous. "That's exactly why I didn't want you to know about me... about my problems."

Her hands clenched into fists.
"Traitor," she whispered.

"Am I lying, AJ?" Lyza asked desperately. "Didn't Kevin say that?"

AJ hesitated. The silence felt unbearable.
"Uh... he did," AJ admitted quietly l'm sorry, Rhema.

Then Kevin laughed.
Not nervous.
Not afraid.

"Yes," he said calmly. "That's all true."
He looked around at them, eyes dark with satisfaction.

"And now... I've finally trapped all of you."

"Ha?!" AJ, Lyza, and Rhema said in unison, fear flooding their voices as the lights flickered above them.
